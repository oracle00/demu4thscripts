## Track Data Processor

Coded by Japanese lang. 

von4_card_loaderr_forDemul.py：
This script runs Demul with arbitrary command‑line options and monitors it by searching for specific keywords within its runtime memory region
It should assist with saving and transferring card data in VO4.

card_data_exchanger.py:
Convert the 207‑byte binary data into the track‑data format used for writing to an actual card.
Track data is converted back into a 207‑byte binary data block.

I want to say thank you Demul WIP developers
