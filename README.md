## VON4 Demul assist script
Since these scripts were originally created in a Japanese environment without strict localization, please adjust them as necessary.

von4_card_loaderr_forDemul.py：
This script runs Demul with arbitrary command‑line options and monitors it by searching for specific keywords within its runtime memory region
You can save and load the card data at any timing.
You can save AI card data as well, and it will become possible to play with your main card while using an AI card at the same time.
English version would be availabe.
If you know of any scripts that can convert card data and player data back and forth, please explain the detail.

card_data_exchanger.py:
Convert the 207‑byte binary data into the track‑data format used for writing to an actual card.
Track data is converted back into a 207‑byte binary data block.

I want to say thank you for Demul WIP developers
